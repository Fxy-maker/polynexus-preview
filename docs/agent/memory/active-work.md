# Active Work

> Last updated: 2026-07-11

## Completed

- Added the root agent contract in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added the agent workflow, definition of done, task template, and testing matrix
  under `docs/agent/`.
- Added `scripts/verify.py` as the unified verification entry point.
- Added this external memory foundation under `docs/agent/memory/`.

## In progress

- GUI startup performance task completed on 2026-07-11. The application entry now uses deferred optional UI construction; focused startup and MainWindow persistence evidence is recorded in `docs/acceptance/2026-07-11-gui-startup-performance.md`.
- SAXS temperature/strain production cutover implementation completed on isolated branch `codex/saxs-temperature-strain-production-cutover`. The shared publisher route, strict no-legacy-fallback behavior for active temperature/strain/unsupported states, and entry-level regression tests are committed. Focused SAXS/shared publication tests pass; full repository pytest exceeded the five-minute runtime limit without a reported failing test. Human architecture/science review is pending before integration.

## Suggested next candidates

1. Add incremental Ruff checks for changed files, then ratchet toward full-repo
   cleanliness.
2. Add a small index or search adapter for memory entries only after the Markdown
   source of truth is being maintained consistently.
3. If the startup target must improve beyond the current approximately 2.7-second fresh-process probe, separately evaluate scientific-stack packaging and lazy technique-registry loading.

## Update protocol

Every active task should record its status, blocker, next action, and evidence
link here when that information will matter to a later agent.
